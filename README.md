**Project Overview:**
This project automates the termination of an Amazon EC2 instance on AWS based on its CPU utilization. The solution utilizes Amazon CloudWatch to set up a custom alarm that monitors CPU utilization and triggers the termination action if it falls below a specified threshold over a defined time period.

**Project Steps:**

1. **EC2 Instance Creation:**
   - Initiate the project by creating an EC2 instance on AWS using the Management Console.
   - Configure instance type, networking, security groups, and relevant settings.

2. **CloudWatch Alarm Setup:**
   - Navigate to the CloudWatch service and create a custom alarm.
   - Set a threshold of 3% CPU utilization over a 15-minute period.

3. **Automated Termination Configuration:**
   - Configure actions for the alarm to automatically terminate the EC2 instance when triggered.
   - The selected action is "Terminate this instance."

4. **Testing:**
   - Use `ec2 connect` or any other preferred method to interact with the EC2 instance and initiate CPU utilization.
   - Observe the CloudWatch dashboard to ensure that CPU utilization metrics are plotted over time.

5. **Monitoring and Observations:**
   - Regularly check the CloudWatch dashboard for real-time monitoring of CPU utilization trends.
   - Confirm that the configured alarm triggers as expected when the specified conditions are met.
